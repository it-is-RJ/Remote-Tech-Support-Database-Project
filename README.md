This project was developed for my CIS-344: Database Management Systems course. The objective was to design and implement a relational database for a Remote Tech Support Service. 
The system manages customers, support tickets, technicians, payments, and customer feedback. The database schema and ER diagrams were designed using MySQL Workbench, and the full implementation was built in MySQL.
This repository contains all required project components, including ER diagrams, SQL scripts, the Workbench model, and the final report.

The database supports the main workflow of a remote tech support company:
- Customers can create accounts and submit support tickets
- Technicians are assigned to tickets based on their skills
- Each ticket stores details such as issue description, status, and priority
- Payments are recorded after the service is completed
- Customers can leave feedback after their issue is resolved

Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench
- MySQL Server
- Workbench diagram tools
- GitHub for version control and submission

How to Run the Project:
- Open the .mwb file in MySQL Workbench to view the database design.
- Run the SQL script in MySQL to create the database.
- Review the ER diagrams to understand the structure of the system.
- Read the project report for detailed explanations of the design decisions.
